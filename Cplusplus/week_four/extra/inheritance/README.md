# Class Inheritance

The original class is called _base class_ and the inheriting class is called _derived class_.

The colon (` BaseClas : public DerivedClass `)

With `public` declaration, the public members of the base class become part of the
derived class. The private portions of a base class become part of derived class
but they can be accessed only through public and protected methods of the
base class.

* A derived class needs its own constructors.
* A derived class can add additional data members and member functions.
