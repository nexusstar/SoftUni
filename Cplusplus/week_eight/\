#Exceptions

_Errors and failures happen_

## Expected errors

Simplest way is to test for them

##Exceptions

Transfer flow of execution from the problem location to somewhere that can handle it.

Deal with it as close to the source as it happens.

```c++
    try
    {
      //risky stuff
    }
    catch(out_of_range& e)
    {
      e.what();
    }
    catch(exception& e)
    {
      e.what();
    }
```
