#Homework 6


1. Brexit

Develop a software that is used for voting on the Britain Referendum for leaving the European union called “Brexit”.

There are two types of users. Voters and result collectors.
For the votes you must develop a terminal Cpp program that is collecting the following data:

* Age

* Name

* Gender

* Living city/village

* Ethos

* Vote

_develop a class describing the voters_

If the user enters “12344321” (special password for the vote collectors) at the main screen, the vote collector menu opens. The vote collectors menu should provide the following results:

* Results in percent

* Results in numbers

* Results based on Age // example output “18 y – 12 000 Stay, 8000 Leave”

* Results based on Name // example output “Name Fiki – 8 Stay, 9 Leave”

* Results based on Ethos

* Results based on Living city/village

All possible for age, living city/village, ethnos // example output

// “Names to choose: Walder Frey, Cersei Lannister, Beric Dondarrion”

Give specific result for an Age, Name, Ethos, Gender or Living City/Village

// for example result collectors enters “21” and the program returns

// “21 y – 19000 Stay, 3000 Leave

Notes:

  Use smart pointers wherever you want to.

  Use Set for collecting names, age etc.

  Use Map for collecting and holding the results for name, age, gender, etc.

  Make the calculation about the current results when the result collector enters his password.

  Use linked list, array, vector, whatever you decide in order to keep the different votes.
