#Pointers

* Pointer is a variable _that holds the address of another variable_

  - Pointer can be used to get to the original place that it was pointing to.
  - Change the value that it points to.
  - Pointer can be changed to point to something else.

  

```c++
    int* pA = &A;
    int *pA = &A;
    //to get throught the pointer to its target
    *pA = 5;
```
