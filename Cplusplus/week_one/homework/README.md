#How to check if on windows

_I am using Linux so there are makefiles for building under it_

## Check under Linux

Navigate to homework/task folder and run  `make`

## Check under Windows with VS

*Create new console application project:
    File > New Project > Empty Project

*Add .cpp file (Shift + Alt + A)
    (right click on solution) > Add > Existing file

_Don't add both files from task01 and task02 to one Project_
